# HideIt - Hide Your Reddit Username!
A small Chrome extension that hides your Reddit username, particularly helpful in a public setting.

## About 
This simple extension works by hiding your Reddit username, so you can browse Reddit in public without compromising your discrete username and identity. 

## Usage

I intend to publish this public repository as a verified extension on the Chrome Web Store for people to download directly without any additional hassle. However, to currently download the extension, you might need to have [Developer Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/faq#faq-dev-01) enabled on your Chrome browser. 

To start off, you can start by typing [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) on your Chrome browser. 

Toggle the **Developer Mode** switch on the top right-hand corner. 

Alternatively, you could click the Chrome menu icon ![](https://developer.chrome.com/static/images/hotdogmenu.png) and select **Extensions** from the **Tools** menu. Ensure that you toggle the **Developer Mode**  switch on the top right-hand corner. 

Clone the repository using 

```bash 
git clone https://www.github.com/agamjolly/HideIt.git
```

On the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page, click on '**Load Unpacked**' option on the left-hand side of the extensions panel. 

Choose the path to where you unzipped the extension in the previous step.

***Voila!*** Your extension is all loaded and you're good to go.
